# ClipEditorV5
A basic, but fast video editor made specifically for rummaging through a tone of shadowplay clips.

Meant for Windows. Uses ffmpeg, if you've installed it somewhere weird, please update the path in `Output#add()` `"C:/ProgramData/chocolatey/bin/ffmpeg.exe"`

There is also no artifact/.jar build, because it: doesn't work, doesn't tell me why it doesn't work and is not neccessary for me.
